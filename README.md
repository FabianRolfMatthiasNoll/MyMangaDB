# MyMangaDB

**MyMangaDB** aims to become the quintessential application for manga collectors. Say goodbye to using Excel sheets or makeshift solutions for managing your manga collection. With **MyMangaDB**, simply input the manga's ~~ISBN or its~~ title and volume, and the application will automatically populate your collection with details like the author(s), description, available volumes, cover art, genres, and more without any manual input from your end.

## üîî Disclaimer

As the development of this project is an endeavor undertaken during my student years, there might be occasional downtimes. But rest assured, I'm committed to building a reliable product and will continue refining it.

And i am happy to announce that Version 1.0.0 is finally released.

## üìñ About MyMangaDB

- **Framework:** FastAPI.
- **Database Management:** SQLAlchemy, as recommended by FastAPI, is used for data management. All data is stored in a local SQLite3 database.
- **Data Sources:**
  - The primary data, including author details, genres, and descriptions, are sourced from the MyAnimeList API.
  - Plans are in place to integrate more data sources for book covers and other specifics.

Due to the varied nature of manga provider websites, the focus is on building an intuitive user interface. This will allow users to efficiently manage their collection.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use (WIP)

### Release Version

To launch the application, simply open the downloaded release file. This action will prompt a window to appear, signifying that the service is now active. Upon initiation, the app will create a local database on your device. Note that the service will cease operation the moment the window is closed. Future updates will introduce user-friendly installation processes for setting up the service as a home server. The database location varies by operating system:

- **Windows:** `User/Appdata/manga.db`
- **Linux:** `user/.config/manga.db`

### Source Code

Setting up the development environment for the first time involves creating a virtual environment. Execute the following command to do so:  
`python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`  
  
Afterward, navigate to the main directory and run the command below to install all required packages:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
   
**Note for Linux users:** Ensure you remove `PyQt5` from the requirements file before proceeding with the installation, to prevent any conflicts.  
  
In the `frontend` directory, you'll need to run:  `npm install`  
This is necessary to install all Node modules for the frontend.  
  
To initiate both the backend and frontend, refer to the settings provided in the `vscode launch.json`. If you need to make database alterations, you can do so by visiting `http://localhost:8000/docs`, which allows direct interaction with the backend. Currently, the frontend is designed to retrieve and display all manga entries from the database, serving as a preliminary demonstration. **Please exercise caution** in using the application extensively, as future updates may introduce changes to the database schema.

### Hosting

To host the application you have to do several steps. 
1. Change the `BASE_PATH` in `frontend/src/api/runtime.ts` to the actual IP-Address of your Device hosting the Backend. **Dont change the Port!**

2. If you want to host a Docker Container set DOCKER_MODE in backend/database.py to True

**Generate API:**
```bash
cd frontend/src/api
npx openapi-generator-cli generate -i http://<Address of the Backend>:8000/openapi.json -g typescript-fetch
```
