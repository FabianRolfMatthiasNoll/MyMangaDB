# Feature Ideas and Plans

## NEXT STEPS
refactor adding mangas to work exactly like when editing mangas
add a add volume option
add a edit volume option
add adding cover images to editing manga, editing volume and adding manga
add fetching cover images automatically
## Dont make Volumes preconfigured
Let the user add themselfes volumes and give the option
to name it (for cases like 0 or 0.5 etc.) and either provide a cover themselves or make a automatic search via a search engine and then let the user choose.

## Volume Specifc Cover displays
Make Search Request with Custom Google Search Engine and
fetch picture results so that the user can choose on of them.

IF ANYONE HAS A IDEA FOR THAT PLEASE CONTACT ME :D

## Make Mangas editable

## Manga Manual Creation
Make "Predicitons" for already existing authors, roles and genres
Get that data from the database or from the loaded mangas in the dashboard

## MetaData Fetching
Maybe switch from myanimelist directly to https://jikan.moe/ as it doesnt require logins and
would be more generally usable.
