# Feature Ideas and Plans

## Dont make Volumes preconfigured
Let the user add themselfes volumes and give the option
to name it (for cases like 0 or 0.5 etc.) and either provide a cover themselves or make a automatic search via a search engine and then let the user choose.

## Volume Specifc Cover displays
Make Search Request with Custom Google Search Engine and
fetch picture results so that the user can choose on of them.

## Make Mangas editable
