# Feature Ideas and Plans

## Frontend changes

- add option to display reading status on cover

## General changes

### Volume Specifc Cover displays

Make Search Request with Custom Google Search Engine and
fetch picture results so that the user can choose on of them.

IF ANYONE HAS A IDEA FOR THAT PLEASE CONTACT ME :D

### Research how to make this a installable application

somehow both services have to be packaged and installed.
As a service the application should start both the frontend and the backend
on the users machine. Later on it should be installable on a raspberryPi so that
the user can host this as a home server if he wants so that its accessible everywhere.
(Maybe also add a password authentification for outside access?)
